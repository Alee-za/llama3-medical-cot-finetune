# 🦙 LLaMA 3 Medical Chain-of-Thought Fine-Tuning

This project fine-tunes the **Meta LLaMA 3 model** for a **medical question-answering task** using **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** prompting. It demonstrates a full pipeline including environment setup, dataset loading, model preparation, training, and evaluation, all optimized for transformer-based LLMs in healthcare contexts.

## 🚀 Running the Notebook

Launch the Jupyter notebook or convert it into a script:

```bash
jupyter notebook llama3_finetune_medical_cot.ipynb
```

The notebook walks through all steps:

* Data loading & preprocessing
* Tokenization
* Model loading
* LoRA config & trainer setup
* Evaluation & sample predictions

---

## 📊 Model Insights

* Model: `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B`
* PEFT: `QLoRA`
* Task: Medical Q\&A (multi-turn possible)
* Prompting: Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

---

## 📌 Notes

* The dataset used is expected to follow a JSON or structured format with `instruction`, `input`, and `output` fields.
* The notebook uses Hugging Face’s `transformers`, `datasets`, `peft`, `trl`, and `accelerate` libraries.
